After pressing the button multiply, the second grid is brought and flipped to the right where the second grid rows becomes columns and the columns become rows. Then, the second grid starts to slide down towards the first grid. When the first row of the second grid meets the numbers of the top row of the first grid, they multiply each other and all the products are added together. The sum of the products becomes the first number of the top row of the output. Then, the grid slides another row down, and it multiplies the next row and adds the products to make the first number of the next row of the product. Simultoneously, if there is another row in the second grid, the second row of numbers in the second grid is multiplied to the top row of the numbers of the first grid. Then they are added to make the next number of the output. This number is the next number of the row. The second grid is multiply a row of number with each row of numbers in the first grid. This is how matrix multiplication does.*"
